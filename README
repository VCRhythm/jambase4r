JamBase4R
=============

JamBase4R is a framework agnostic Ruby wrapper around the JamBase live music search API.
(http://developer.jambase.com/docs)

This gem can be used to create mashups where your users might want to search for live music. This gem is a
replacement for a Ruby on Rails plugin that I wrote a while back called JamBase4Rails. Since Rails is no longer
promoting the use of traditional plugins, but rather gems, I thought it was time to do a re-write.

**Note: JamBase requires that any site making use of it's API provide attribution.
See http://developer.jambase.com/docs for more information. This gem provides 
helpers to make adding attribution to your site easy.

This gem adds helper methods to your views (if you are using Rails), but does not alter controllers or
models in any way.

Installation
============

1) get and install the gem
	a) gem sources -a http://gems.github.com (you only have to do this once)
	b) sudo gem install mattapayne-jambase4r


2) run the jambase4r:install_assets rake task - this ensures that the images
   required by the helpers are in place.
**NOTE: This functionality is currently under development **

Configuration
=============

Using the JamBase API requires that you register for an API key. Get one here:
http://developer.jambase.com/member/register

In an initializer, add the following configuration:

#app_specific_initializers.rb

JamBase4R.configure do |config|
  config.api_key = "XXXXXXXXXXXXX"
end

Example
=======

To make use of JamBase4R just use the JamBase4R::API object.

Available methods (all are class methods):

All methods return an instance of an Array, which contains zero or more Event objects

1) JamBase4R::API.search(options)
2) JamBase4R::API.search_by_artist(artist_name, additional_options={})
3) JamBase4R::API.search_by_zipcode(zipcode, additional_options={})

Possible options:

:band (or :artist (an alias for :band)) => The name of the band to search for.
:zip => The zipcode to search within
:radius => The distance from the zipcode to include in the search

ie: JamBase4R::API.search(:band => "A Band", :zip => "90210", :radius => 20)
    JamBase4R::API.search_by_artist("A Band", {:zip => "90210"})
    JamBase4R::API.search_by_zipcode("90210")

The general schema of the results is:

 - events
 	- event
       - event_id (String)
        - event_date (String)
        - event_url (String)
		- ticket_url (String)
        - venue (Venue)
            - venue_id (String)
            - venue_name (String)
            - venue_city (String)
            - venue_state (String)
            - venue_zip (String)
        - artists (Artists)
            - Artist(s) (Artist)
                - artist_id
                - artist_name
